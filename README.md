I can provide a meticulously designed React Single-Page Application (SPA) prototype focusing on the frontend UI/UX and data visualization aspects.


This prototype will demonstrate:

An intuitive and responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS.
Real-time data visualization through dynamically updating charts powered by Chart.js.
A simulated live flight data feed, showcasing flight information and status updates.
Basic search and filtering capabilities for flights.
A clean, professional aesthetic derived from a vibrant Material Design color palette.
